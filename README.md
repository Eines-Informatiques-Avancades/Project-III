### Aim:

To learn how to work in a group around a computational science project by using all the tools
learned during the course.

### Scientific goal:

Build a simple molecular dynamics program to deal with a Van der Waals gas of particles. All
students must perform collaborative work to get a working program code. Thus, all the tasks
involved in the implementation of this program must be decided accordingly.
